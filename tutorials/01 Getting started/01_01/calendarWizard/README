I. Introduction
======================================================= 
Thanks for taking the time to try this script and especially to read the 
help files.  I hope it will be of value to you.  If you come across any 
bugs or have ideas for feature enhancements please email me at 
saselberg@gmail.com

For the most part the functionality of the script is quite obvious and the 
documentation is here more for completeness rather than necessity.  
However, I believe the documentation provides significant value in two 
specific areas: the multi-layer feature and the holidays feature.  I would 
therefore recommend reading them.

In the table below, I've listed the latest version of the script which is 
known to work.

======================================================= 
IV. Installation
======================================================= 
Relocate the following items into a sub-directory of
the Adobe InDesign Scripts.  It is recommended to install 
them into a sub-directory called "calendarWizard":
   
   calendarWizard.js
   holidays
   realignCalendarTables.js
   fitCalendarToFrame.js

In CS2, it's usually something like "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Creative 
Suite 2\Adobe InDesign CS2\Presets\Scripts" 

In CS and CS2, I've been unable to detect where the script 
has been installed to; however I can locate the directory containing Adobe 
InDesign itself.  To that end the script will expect the "holidays" folder 
to be in "Presets/Scripts/calendarWizard".  

In CS3 and above, there are two options.  To install the script for all users of the 
computer, put the scripts in "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Creative Suite 
3\Adobe InDesign CS3\Scripts\Scripts Panel".  Or to install the script 
only for a particular user, put them in "C:\Documents and 
Settings\<username>\Application Data\Adobe\InDesign\Version 
5.0\Scripts\Scripts Panel".  By default, the "Application Data" directory 
is a hidden directory.  In the Windows folder options settings you can 
tell windows to show hidden directories.  

Once the files have been copied to this directory, they will show up in 
InDesign's scripts palette.  

A note on upgrading:
Before upgrading to a new version of the script, please
remove any old versions.  They can be deleted or relocated
to a directory outside of the InDesign scripts folder. If 
InDesign finds two copies, it will link to the older one.

======================================================= 
V. Features
======================================================= 

A. Multi-Month Calendar Generation
-------------------------------------------------------
The script is able to generate a set of calendars from a start month up to 
and including the end month.  The range of years in the drop down box are 
determined by the current year minus three to the current year plus ten.  

B. Layout Options
-------------------------------------------------------
The calendars may be placed in a number of ways. 
The script will try and generate the calendar in a predefined text frame 
if a text frame is selected or the cursor is in a text frame and the page 
type is set to either 'AUTO' or 'Current Text Frame'.  When generating 
into the current frame, a calendar for only one month may be produced.  

If a text frame is not selected, the "Auto" page type will create a new 
document and add a page in either landscape or portrait mode depending 
upon the setting in the dialog box.  When the script generates a new page 
or pages it can place 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, or 12 calendars per page in a 
grid layout.  

If the user selects "Current Document" as the page type, the script
will use the current document adding pages if necessary.  This is particularly
useful in conjunction with the custom calendar placement/sizing to get
multiple calendars on the same page.

A custom page size may be selected by entering in the desired height 
and width (numbers or a decimal only).  By specifying both an height and
a width, these fields become active and will override the standard 
page selection fields.  

Optionally, the value of the page  margins can be specified. Note - 
the margin field works independently of the height and width and can
also be used when a standard page size is selected.  It was included
with the custom height and width to make the dialog box look pretty.

There are a set of four text entry boxes for specifying the size and
position of the calendar.  The text entry boxes are graphically presented
for specifying the top and bottom, left and right corners of the calendar.
The script will ignore these values unless all four have numeric (and
numeric only values)

C. Calendar Options
-------------------------------------------------------
When generating the calendar, there are a few useful options.  

i.  Multi-Language
At the time of this writing, the script supports 16 languages.  To add a 
new language, the script needs to be modified in two places.  Towards the 
top is a list of langageOptions.  (Do a word search for 
"settings.languageOptions".) Add the english name for the new language 
into the list in alphabetical order.  The second modification is made in 
the "selectLangauge" subroutine at the bottom of the script.  To add 
another language copy and paste an else/if block and modify it as needed.  
The English name of the language in the first part modification to match 
the name of the language in the second modification.  

Note, changing the language only changes the month and day names, it 
will not alter the language of the holidays being printed.  For that a
multi-language holiday pack will be needed.

ii. Start on Sunday or Monday
The "Start on Sunday or Monday" option controls which day of the week will 
be the first column.  If Monday is selected, Sunday will become the last 
column.  

iii.  Date Rows 
The Date Rows selection is used to fix the number of rows in each month.  
Some months may have six weeks (six rows) while others have only 5.  In a 
non-leap year February may end up with only 4 weeks.  If "5" is selected 
and there are 6 weeks, the last row will have diagonal lines separating 
the second to last week and the last week.  If "6" is selected and there 
are only 5 weeks, an empty row will be generated.  The "Auto" setting will 
allow the script to make as many rows as necessary (4, 5, or 6) to 
accommodate the number of days in the month.  

When dealing with features that put items into the date cells (such as 
holidays or the moon phase) you may not restrict the calendar to 5 rows.  
I couldn't think of a programatic solution to deal with placing items into 
the cells that belong to two dates, so that case is just not allowed.

iv.  Mini-Calendars
When included, small calendars of the preceding and following month are 
included to the left and right of the month name.  This option can really 
slow down the script.  

The mini-calendars are hard-coded to be 0.75 inches square.  This is the 
smallest size I could make.  In the script the variable called 
miniCalendarSize sets the size.  The first two numbers determine the upper 
left corner, presently ("2", "2").  The last two set the bottom right 
corner ("2.75", "2.75").  To make the calendar bigger, enlarge the values 
of the last two numbers.  Note, the table is moved after it is built, so 
all that matters is the relative spacing between the two points.  

When making multiple tables per page, the mini-calendars don't really make 
much sense and they make the formatting look really ugly.  I decided that 
at four calendars per page, somebody might find it useful, but above that 
no.  So, I put a lockout which prevents the mini calendar from being 
activated at greater than four calendars per page.  

v.  Add Work Week
If the "Include Work Weeks" checkbox is selected, the script will add a 
column to the left with a number indicating the week of the year 

vi. Add Non-Month Days
If the "Include Non-Month Days" checkbox is selected, the days of the 
preceding and following month that are in the first or last weeks of the 
month will be included.  

vii. Highlight Sundays
If selected, the column of sundays will be given a distinct cell and 
paragraph style.  (the default color is red).  If "Highlight Sundays" and 
"Include Non-Month Days" are both selected, the non-month sundays will 
also be given a distinct cell and paragraph style.  

viii. Highlight Holidays
If selected, the dates with holidays will be given a distinct cell and 
paragraph style.  (the default color is red).  If "Highlight Sundays"
is selected and the holiday is a sunday, the holidayDate style will be
applied.  

D. Calendar Decoration
-------------------------------------------------------
i. Use of Styles
The script makes extensive use of color swatches, paragraph and cell 
styles to make the final result easy to customize.

Below is a map of the styles.  With a few exceptions called out below, 
the styles exist as both paragraph and cell styles.  Note the cell
styles will use the identically named paragraph style.

          -- cal_rightMiniCalendar (used to control the cell with the right mini-calendar)
          -- calMini_base -- (base style used in the mini-calendars)
                           |
                           -- calMini_title (see cal_title)
                           -- calMini_day (see cal_day)
                           -- calMini_text (see cal_text)

Table Styles
        cal_date
        cal_holiday
        cal_text
        cal_moons
        cal_pictures

iii.  Holiday A, B, C, and D Styles 
When generating the calendar, there are four checkboxes next to each of 
the available holiday sets.  If a box is checked, the holidays defined by 
that list will be placed in the cell with that style applied.  The desire 
is to highlight different types of holidays (for example, Christian holidays 
vs.  birthdays).  If two or more checkboxes are selected, the first 
alphabetically will be used.  (i.e., if A & B are selected, A will be 
used).  

ii. Colorspace
The script can generate color swatches in RGB, CMYK, or LAB color space.  
This is controlled by a drop down menu in the calendar generation GUI.  

iii. Style Sets
When using the custom calendar placement, it is sometimes desirable
to place more than one calendar on a page and have different styles for
each of the calendars.  There is therefore a dropdown menu in the custom
calendar size section for the style set.  This will add the number as a
suffix to each of the styles generated by that run of the script.  This 
allows the generation of multiple calendars each with a distinct set
of styles to control it's appearance.

E. Multi-Layer Calendar
-------------------------------------------------------
When I started to develop and use this script, I found it a pain to create 
the calendar, type in one cell, tab to the next and promptly delete the 
date by typing over it.  My solution was to generate the calendar as 
multiple super-imposed tables putting each on their own layer.  The 
calendar currently supports up to 5 layers: calDates, calHolidays, 
calPictures, calMoons, and calText.  By default, only the text layer is 
selected.  This will place the table with the calendar dates on the 
current layer and a second super-imposed table on a new layer called 
calText.  

In general the multi-layer scheme works really well; however, there is a 
complication.  If you want to resize any of the cells in the calendar or 
the calendar itself, all three associated tables need identical 
modifications.  This is rather painful to do manually.  The solution to these
problems are fitCalendarToFrame.js and realignCalendarTables.js.

i. Layers
a. Use Calendar Layer
If the "Use Calendar Layer" is selected, the table with the dates will be 
placed on a new layer called calDates rather than the current layer.  

b. Add Holidays Layer
A superimposed table will be created with holiday cell and paragraphs styles
applied and placed in the calHolidays layers.  Any selected holidays will be added
entered into the appropriate cell of the holidays table.  The holidays table and
layer will be automatically generated if any of the holiday sets are selected.

c. Add Picture Layer
A superimposed table will be created with picture cell and paragraphs 
styles applied and placed in the calPictures layers.  Each cell of the 
table contains an empty rectangular frame into which a picture may be 
placed.  

d. Add Moon Phases
A superimposed table will be created with moon cell and paragraphs 
styles applied and placed in the calMoons layers.  The new, full, half
waxing, and half waning moons will be placed in the appropriate cell.
The full moon will be a solid circle, the new moon a circle with no fill.

I don't completely trust the algorithm used to compute the phase of the 
moon, so use with caution.

e. Add Text Layer
A superimposed table will be created with text cell and paragraphs 
styles applied and placed in the calText layers.  It should be the 
top layer and provides a place to enter any text desired.

ii. fitCalendarToFrame.js
fitCalendarToFrame is another javascript which is used to resize all 
layers of the calendar with even cell spacing into the selected text 
frame.  If the work week is included, it will be given a 0.25" cell width.  

caution: The adobe script engine fails to work on cells that are not 
visible.  This can be quite a pain when trying to reduce the size of the 
calendar.  Sometimes it works to run the script several times because as
cells in the top are reduced, cells in the bottom become visible.

When executed with a calendar table selected, it becomes the master.  All 
of the layers of the calendar will be adjusted to the selected table.  If 
no frame is selected, a dialog box is brought up and the user needs to 
specify which calendar and frame will be the master.  Under the hood, 
each calendar table has a label such as calendarDates1, calendarHolidays1, 
and calendarText1.  The number is the id of the calendar.  So a page with 
four calendars will have calendarDates1, calendarDates2, , calendarDates3, 
and calendarDates4.  To figure out which calendar has which label, select 
it and open up the "Scripts Labels" palette.  As an options, all may be 
selected in which case every calendar in the document will be adjusted.  

iii. realignCalendarTables.js
realignCalendarTablse.js is another javascript which is used to align
all of the calendar layers to a particular one.  For example, if un-even
column spacing is desired one layer can be tweaked into place and this
script would push the other layers into an exact super-position of the
tweaked table.

The rules for selecting the table are the same as for the 
fitCalendarToFrame.js script.  

F. Holidays
-------------------------------------------------------
Version 2 of the calendar wizard had the ability to automatically place 
holidays defined by a formatted list from an active text frame; In version 
3 the ability has been expanded to pull multiple lists from the current 
text frame, a file anywhere on the computer, or from text files in a 
pre-defined directory.  

If two holidays are listed for the same date, they will both be printed in 
the cell separated by a new line.  If the text of a holiday exactly 
appears in two of more lists, only the first occurrence will be printed.  
Note text of the holidays must be exact.  Any differences in 
spelling, capitalization, or extra space will cause the script to consider
them different and print both.

i. Holiday List Format:
The format of a holiday is either: mm-dd-yyyy:text or mm-dd:text

Note, the script does not use leading 0's, so use 1-1 for January 1st
rather than 01-01. The text could be anything.  For example:

1-1:New Year's Day
1-19-2009:Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday

For holidays which occur on the same date every year, such as new year's 
day or somebody's birthday, it's best to use the format "mm-dd".  When the 
holiday changes from year to year, such as Easter, use "mm-dd-yyyy".  

The longer the holiday list is, the longer it will take to generate
a calendar regardless if the holidays occur in that month or not.

ii. Selecting a Holiday List
When selecting a holiday list there are four styles: A, B, C, and D.  
Checking any of the styles will trigger the script to use that holiday 
list.  The particular style is simply there to allow the user to 
differentiate between different types of holidays (for example Christian 
Holidays and birthdays) The first style in alphabetical order is the one 
that will be used if multiple styles are selected.  

iii. Loading from the Current Frame
The list of holidays can be typed into a text frame. If the frame is selected
and a style for the "From Current Frame" is selected, the script will load
and print the holidays from that frame. 

Note, when selected, the behavior of "Auto" for the page setting changes.  
In this case a new document will be created so the date information is not 
destroyed.  If you want to replace the holiday text with the calendar, set 
Page to "Current Text Frame".  

iv. Loading from a Custom File
If selected, the script will bring up a dialog box in which one or more
files may be selected.  They are expected to be simple text files (not
MW Word documents) that adhere to the holiday list format described above.
Notepad or some other simple text editor is a good tool to use for 
generating the text files rather than a Word Processor like MS Word.  If you
do use Word or OpenOffice, be sure to save the file as a simple text file (.txt)

v. Loading from Pre-Defined Files
In InDesign version above CS2, when the script runs, it will look for a 
folder called "holidays" next to the script itself.  In CS1 and CS2, the 
folder must be at "<InDesign Install Folder>/Presets/Scripts/calendarWizard". 
On the calendarWizard interface, a set of checkboxes will be created for 
every file that ends in ".holidays" inside that folder.  The files are 
expected to conform to the holiday list specification.

VI. Behavior Rules
======================================================= 

======================================================= 
VII. To Do
======================================================= 
Add a templating feature

Add a dropdown for which style set to apply (when multiple
calendars per page are used and different styles are
desired on the different calendars.)

Add the ability to add other units.

======================================================= 
VIII. Bugs
======================================================= 
In CS2, the upper right cell has a right border:As far as I can tell, this 
is a bug in the javascript interpreter in CS an CS2.  I don't know how to 
fix it.

X. History
======================================================= 
A. Version 1.0
B. Version 2.0
C. Version 3.0

======================================================= 
XI: Notes:
======================================================= 

Troubleshooting:
  The script causes InDesign to Hang:
     The script is very slow - especially in CS and CS2.  Give it plenty of time
     to work and everything will start to work.
